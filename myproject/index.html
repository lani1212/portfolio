				Let me tell you why I create this website. After I graduated I was struggling about what position and what kind of job I want to work.
				Because my major is Data Management in the Field of Health Care, if I want to keep my major so I have to find job on the hospital 
				and there were not many jobs available. After I met my boyfriend, who is Web Developer, he told me why I can't learn more about the Front-end, <br>
				beacause I already have IT background and I just learn more about it. So I decided to learn more about HTML/CSS/JavaScript/jQuery... on the 
				online course like Treehouse, Udemy and Pluralsight.
				So this website I create is my Portfolio to show to the Employer my skills. On this website include all of the front-end tech and my profile.
